# Integrating Argos with Playwright for Visual Testing

Boost your visual testing capabilities by combining Argos with your [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) tests.

While Playwright inherently provides screenshot functionality, the Argos Playwright integration enhances this by:

- Ensuring all images are fully loaded.
- Ensuring all fonts are rendered.
- Confirming the absence of any `aria-busy` (loading) elements on the page.
- Concealing scrollbars.
- Obscuring text cursors or carets.
- Providing CSS utilities to simplify content hiding.
- Gives you visility on test failures.

## 1. Setting Up

### Installation of Packages

```
npm install --save-dev @argos-ci/playwright @playwright/test
```

### Configure Argos Reporter

The Argos reporter seamlessly uploads test screenshots to Argos in real-time.

```ts
// playwright.config.{js,ts}
import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  reporter: [["list"], ["@argos-ci/playwright/reporter"]],
});
```

## 2. Take screenshots

`argosScreenshot` command stabilizes the UI before capturing the screenshot.

```js
import { test } from "@playwright/test";
import { argosScreenshot } from "@argos-ci/playwright";

test.describe("Homepage", () => {
  test("take screenshot", async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto(TEST_URL);
    await argosScreenshot(page, "homepage");
  });
});
```

## 3. Setup your CI

Execute your Playwright tests in the usual manner. Screenshots will be auto-uploaded.

> Note: For CI platforms other than GitHub Actions, ensure `ARGOS_TOKEN` is set as an environment variable.

## API Overview

### argosScreenshot(page, name[, options])

- `page`: Instance of the [Playwright Page](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page).
- `name`: Unique name for the screenshot.
- `options`: Explore [Page.screenshot command options](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-screenshot) for details.
- `options.element`: Use an ElementHandle or string selector to capture a specific element's screenshot.
- `options.viewports`: Define specific viewports for capturing screenshots. More on [viewports configuration](https://argos-ci.com/docs/viewports).

### Argos Reporter

The Argos reporter offers extensive configuration options. Specifically, all [upload parameters](https://js-sdk-reference.argos-ci.com/interfaces/uploadparameters) are available for customizing the reporter.

```ts
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";
import type { ArgosReporterOptions } from "@argos-ci/playwright/reporter";

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  reporter: [
    ["list"],
    [
      "@argos-ci/playwright/reporter",
      {
        buildName: "custom-build-name",
      } as ArgosReporterOptions,
    ],
  ],
});
```

## Capturing Screenshots on Test Failures

Playwright's [recording options](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-use-options#recording-options) facilitate the automated capture of screenshots upon test failures. Notably, these captured screenshots are then automatically uploaded to Argos.

```ts
// playwright.config.{js,ts}

import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";

export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    // Setting to capture screenshot only when a test fails.
    screenshot: "only-on-failure",
  },
});
```

## Helper Attributes for Visual Testing

For tailored visual testing, the `data-visual-test` attributes provide control over how elements appear in Argos screenshots. This can be especially useful for obscuring or modifying elements with dynamic content, like dates.

- `[data-visual-test="transparent"]`: Renders the element transparent (`visiblity: hidden`).
- `[data-visual-test="removed"]`: Removes the element from view (`display: none`).
- `[data-visual-test="blackout"]`: Masks the element with a blackout effect.
- `[data-visual-test-no-radius]`: Strips the border radius from the element.

**Example: Using a helper attribute to hide a div from the captured screenshot:**

```html
<div id="clock" data-visual-test="transparent">...</div>
```
